				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<h5><span>Developer</span> & <span>Digital Business</span></h5>
				<p>I'm 21 years old and up until highschool I wanted to be a doctor, I read books, watched documentaries, everything that was related to medicine, especially neural health.
                    But before I got to college I decided to go for a less-demanding career so, as I enjoyed tweaking and playing with computers since I was little, 
                    I picked my 2nd choice which was IT (Software Development). I started looking for universities outside Chihuahua, the city I'm from.A few weeks later 
                    I got an opportunity to study IT and Digital Business at Anáhuac Querétaro University, so I accepted and moved to the new city. In college I learned 
                    a lot about IT and how to work with it. I also learned how to work with people and how to work in a team. Some of the topics I learned are: Web Development, 
                    Mobile Development, Cloud Computing, Proyect Management, among others. This helped me get a general view about IT to pick a specific path in the future. I got 
                    really interested in cybersecurity but getting an entry-level job in Mexico is extremely difficult, that's why I'm going to prepare myself this next few years
                    in Full Stack Development, and at the same time get certifications on cybersecurity and cloud computing. That way I can be more prepared by the time I'll 
                    apply to a Cybersecurity job.

					<p>
                        Development of a web page for a packaging company, where we used React, HTML, Javascript, and CSS to create a responsive website. We also
                        used Bootstrap to give it a better look and connected the Stripe API to enable payment through the website.

					<p>
                        I developed a live-messaging app in AWS using different services. I also have an Architeting with Google Compute Engine specialization and 
                        several GCP labs completed in Qwicklabs. During this courses, I managed to gain some experience using with Docker, Kubernetes, CLI, and servers.

				<h5>Proyect Management</h5>
				<div class="pra">
					<p>
                        In several proyects, I worked with Agile methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, and XP. I learned how to work in a team, delegate tasks
                        and organize our time and effort. I also experienced how to talk and communicate effectively with the client, 
                        as they sometimes can have a difficult attitude towards developers.
